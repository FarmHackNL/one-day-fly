## Team vive-unity
Use the HTC Vive and Unity to visualize and interact with real data from a farmer (Van den Borne).

We are visualizing Jabobs 3D data in Unity using the HTC Vive. The challenge he is facing is the large amount of plots he has to inspect. Driving to each one takes too much time. In addition, comparing data using visual inspection is cumbersome.

Using one or multiple HTC Vive's the farmer can virtually inspect a plot without leaving the VR control room. Also, using the Vive game controllers, data statistics are within reach, especially temporal data. The next step is sharing his virtual environment in order to e.g. get a second opion or share his data with other farmers or specialists.
